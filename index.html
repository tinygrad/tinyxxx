<h1>we are the tiny corp</h1>

<li>Do you find yourself millions of dollars in the hole building an AI accelerator chip?</li>
<li>Jumped the gun and built hardware before you had the software ready?</li>
<li>Have a SoC with a hard to use Neural Network SDK? (Qualcomm, Rockchip)</li>
<li>Just wish your accelerator was faster? (NVIDIA, Google)</li>

<p>The tiny corp can help. We can port our framework to any accelerator.</p>

<hr>

<p>We write and maintain <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad">tinygrad</a>, the fastest growing neural network framework (over 9000 GitHub stars)<p>

<p>It's extremely simple, and breaks down <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/examples/stable_diffusion.py">the most complex networks</a> into 4 <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/ops.py">OpTypes</a></p>

<li><b>UnaryOps</b> operate on one tensor and run elementwise. RELU, LOG, RECIPROCAL, etc...</li>
<li><b>BinaryOps</b> operate on two tensors and run elementwise to return one. ADD, MUL, etc...</li>
<li><b>ReduceOps</b> operate on one tensor and return a smaller tensor. SUM, MAX</li>
<li><b>MovementOps</b> operate on one tensor and move the data around, copy-free with <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/shape/__init__.py">ShapeTracker</a>. RESHAPE, PERMUTE, EXPAND, etc...</li>

<p>But how...where are your CONVs and MATMULs? Read the code to solve this mystery.</p>

<p>FAQ:</p>

<em>Is tinygrad used anywhere?</em><br/></br>
tinygrad is used in <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">openpilot</a> to run the driving model on the Snapdragon 845 GPU. It replaces <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/sites/default/files/docs/snpe/overview.html">SNPE</a>, is faster, supports loading onnx files, supports training, and allows for attention (SNPE only allows fixed weights).
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>Is tinygrad inference only?</em><br/></br>
No! It supports full forward and backward passes with autodiff. <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/master/tinygrad/mlops.py">This</a> is implemented at a level of abstraction higher than the accelerator specific code, so a tinygrad port gets you this for free.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>How can I use tinygrad for my next ML project?</em><br/></br>
Follow the installation instructions on <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad">the tinygrad repo</a>. It has a similar API to PyTorch, yet simpler and more refined. Less stable though while tinygrad is in alpha, so be warned, though it's been fairly stable for a while.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>When will tinygrad leave alpha?</em><br/></br>
When we can reproduce a common set of papers on 1 NVIDIA GPU 2x faster than PyTorch. We also want the speed to be good on the M1. ETA, Q2 next year.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>How is tinygrad faster than PyTorch?</em><br/></br>
For most use cases it isn't yet, but it will be. It has three advantages:
<li>It compiles a custom kernel for every operation, allowing extreme shape specialization.</li>
<li>All tensors are lazy, so it can aggressively fuse operations.</li>
<li>The backend is 10x+ simpler, meaning optimizing one kernel makes everything fast.</li>

<em>How can I work with the tiny corporation?</em><br/></br>

Email me, geohot@gmail.com. We are looking for contracts and sponsorships to improve various aspects of tinygrad. I would also consider an internship where I work on tinygrad in the context of a company.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>How can I work for the tiny corporation?</em><br/></br>

Contribute to <a href="https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad">tinygrad</a> on GitHub.
<br/><br/><br/>

<em>Can I invest in the tiny corporation?</em><br/></br>

It's too tiny to have any equity to sell. We are looking for contracts and sponsorships.

<em>When are you launching your governance token? Will there be an airdrop?</em><br/></br>
